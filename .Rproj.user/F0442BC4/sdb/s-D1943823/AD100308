Load the dataset of your choice and get information about its structure\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(languageR)\n\nstr(selfPacedReadingHeid)\n# I have loaded the dataset I am going to work with.\n# I have looked at its structure\n```\n2. Tidy the dataset (every variable gets a column, every observation occupies a single row), if necessary.\n```{r}\nstr(selfPacedReadingHeid)\nmy_data <- selfPacedReadingHeid %>%\n  select(., x = RT1WordLater, y = RT)\n# The dataset seems to be tidied.\n# I have created a new dataset with the variables I am interested in.\n```\n3. Calculate descriptive statistics of your choice.\n```{r}\nmy_data %>%\n  ggplot(., aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +\n  labs(x = 'Reaction Time in Following Word', y = 'Reaction Time in -Heid word')\n\n# I have made a scatterplot using the two variables and set lm through the data.\n```\nThe mean reaction time for -Heid word was `r mean(my_data$y)`, with a standard deviation of `r sd(my_data$y)`. The median was `r median(my_data$y)`.\nOn the other hand, the mean reaction time for the word following the -Heid words was `r mean(my_data$x)`, with a standard deviation of `r median(my_data$x)`, while the median was `r sd(my_data$x)`.\n\n4. Select two continuous variables and fit a model to the data (bivariate regression).\n```{r}\nmyfit <- lm(x ~ y, data = my_data)\nsummary(myfit)\n# I had already selected my variables before.\n```\n5. Generate a plot that includes a regression line.\n```{r}\nmy_data %>%\n  ggplot(., aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +\n  labs(x = 'Reaction Time in Following Word', y = 'Reaction Time in -Heid word')\n# I had already created this plot above; plots help me visualize the data.\n```\n6. Write up some general observations (1-2 paragraphs max)\n\nThe linear model fit in the data shows that there exists a positive correlation between y (Reaction Time in the -Heid Word) and x (Reaction Time in Word Following the -Heid Word). Specifically, as Y increases in one unit, X increases in 0.21274 units.\n\nHowever, the multiple R-squared is 0.07445 and the adjusted R-squared is 0.07373. According to Lewis-Beck, a value over .90 is necessary for the results to be trustwhorty in the hard sciences and .30 in the social sciences. Therefore, our results are not reliable: Reaction Time in -Heid Words are not a predictor for Reaction Time in the Following Word.\n",
